To execute, run main.py from the command line. A set of options will come up for algorithms (both clustering and dim. redux).
Another set of options will come up upon choosing algorithm for dataset. Neural network can be run on both datasets, but only GAMMA is used for the analysis.
All necessary figures and charts are saved in a 'figures' subdirectory, which will be created upon running the code.

Requirements:
  
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    scipy
    sklearn
